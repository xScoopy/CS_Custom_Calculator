# CS_Custom_Calculator
Custom Calculator assignment in CS 1.0
This custom calculator will assist in simple calculations of DPS!(Damage per Second)
In this program, we will assume all damage values provided by the user are per second values for simplicity's sake. 
You will provide values for a Helmet, Chestpiece, Pants, and a Weapon!
You will then provide a bossfight estimated length (in minutes)
The program will then break down the information provided to give you an overall damage per second you'd do during the encounter, and an overall count of damage you would do by the end of the encounter. 

**With assuming each piece of gear has a value measured in damage per second already, the calculation for dps won't be necessary since the gear added together will provide how much damage will be done per second. 

A second revision of the program would be needed to take stats, and attack speed into account for a more dynamic calculation of the 'per second' damage. 

For now the calculator will be used for total damage done throughout a boss fight encounter given damage values and duration of the boss fight.
