# CS_Custom_Calculator
Custom Calculator assignment in CS 1.0
This custom calculator will assist in simple calculations of DPS!(Damage per Second)
In this program, we will assume all damage values provided by the user are per second values for simplicity's sake. 
You will provide values for a Helmet, Chestpiece, Pants, and a Weapon!
You will then provide a bossfight estimated length (in minutes)
The program will then break down the information provided to give you an overall damage per second you'd do during the encounter, and an overall count of damage you would do by the end of the encounter.
